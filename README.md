Armor Rework for OpenXCom

The original UFO Enemy Unknown used weapon damage range 0-200% and subtracted the armor from that roll to get the final damage. 
This approach is highly unpredictable and detracts from the game experience in my opinion. 

Let's say I have a veteran soldier with about 55HP in Power/Flying Suit who gets randomly hit by single shot Heavy Plasma. According to the formula, the result is roughly:
- 50% nothing happens, the damage is fully absorbed
- 25% the soldier is wounded
- 25% my precious veteran soldier is instantly killed

My expectation would be that the soldier would definitely get more or less serious wound, but not get killed - but that happens only in around 25% cases. 
On the other hand, it is not uncommon for rookie soldier in Power/Flying Suit to receive three point blank hits from Heavy Plasma and survive all this completely healthy.
At the same time, weaker weapons may easily get completely ineffective against some more advanced armors like Power Suit or Tank armor.




My approach is to roll damage in 50%-150% range, and  make armor reduce that damage in two ways:
1) proportional reduction - armors have reduced vulnerability to essentially all damage types
2) small flat bonus - after the above, damage is reduced by small flat amount, small enough so that most hits do at least some damage

For example: 
My Power Armor has 40% proportional reduction and atop of that another flat 25 points reduction (frontal).
Heavy Plasma shot deals somewhere between 58 and 172 damage.
After proportional reduction that is roughly 23 to 69, and after subsequent flat reduction that is 0 to 44 hp down - enough to kill a rookie but not my veteran. 
However, more such shots will almost invariably lead to heavy wounds and eventually, death.

In this mod, you will use Medikits much more often, and your soldiers will spend more time in sickbay.
Not saying this is more "realistic", but definitely less randomness makes the game more strategic and ultimately more satisfying experience.

As healing is more important here, this mod adds two types of Medikits:

Basic MediPack - Large and clumsy and only provides 3 heals; Available on market from the start
Advanced Medikit - research unlocked after Aliend Surgery and Examination Room research completed. Lighter, smaller, provides 6 heals and restores more HP
